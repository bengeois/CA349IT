## Amasson project overview

Amasson is an electronic goods retailer in Ireland. The new system will launch a website to provide customers and employees customized browsing of the product catalog and the ability to complete product orders online. This document outlines the functional, performance, security and other system requirements identified by the development team as the proposed information system solution for the Amasson cloud-based solution.
The Amasson websiteâ€™s primary function is to allow ordering their products online. This is accomplished via secure account registration and payment process. The website also allows client users to track their order directly on their account dashboard.
This new system provides a completely new online stock management to employees to help them order products to manufacturers when stocks are low. This also includes notification to get orders ready for the daily shipment.
Finally, this new experience allows the company to extend its visibility online and attract new clients via promotion period. This requires a scalable system to handle periods with lots of activities and visits.
